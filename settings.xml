 | This is the configuration file for Maven. It can be specified at two levels:
 |
 |  1. User Level. This settings.xml file provides configuration for a single user,
 |                 and is normally provided in ${user.home}/.m2/settings.xml.
 |
 |                 NOTE: This location can be overridden with the CLI option:
 |
 |                 -s /path/to/user/settings.xml
 |
 |  2. Global Level. This settings.xml file provides configuration for all Maven
 |                 users on a machine (assuming they're all using the same Maven
 |                 installation). It's normally provided in
 |                 ${maven.conf}/settings.xml.
 |
 |                 NOTE: This location can be overridden with the CLI option:
 |
 |                 -gs /path/to/global/settings.xml
 |
 | The sections in this sample file are intended to give you a running start at
 | getting the most out of your Maven installation. Where appropriate, the default
 | values (values used when the setting is not specified) are provided.

    <!-- localRepository
     | The path to the local repository maven will use to store artifacts.
     |
     | Default: ${user.home}/.m2/repository
    <localRepository>/path/to/local/repo</localRepository>
    -->

    <!-- interactiveMode
     | This will determine whether maven prompts you when it needs input. If set to false,
     | maven will use a sensible default value, perhaps based on some other setting, for
     | the parameter in question.
     |
     | Default: true
    <interactiveMode>true</interactiveMode>

    <!-- offline
     | Determines whether maven should attempt to connect to the network when executing a build.
     | This will have an effect on artifact downloads, artifact deployment, and others.
     |
     | Default: false
    <offline>false</offline>

    <!-- pluginGroups
     | This is a list of additional group identifiers that will be searched when resolving plugins by their prefix, i.e.
     | when invoking a command line like "mvn prefix:goal". Maven will automatically add the group identifiers
     | "org.apache.maven.plugins" and "org.codehaus.mojo" if these are not already contained in the list.

    <!-- proxies
     | This is a list of proxies which can be used on this machine to connect to the network.
     | Unless otherwise specified (by system property or command-line switch), the first proxy
     | specification in this list marked as active will be used.
     |-->
